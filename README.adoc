== First installment.

This project shows how you can build a typy hierarchy with Java  14+ `record` types.


* The Java record is a final immutable class with
** final means it can't be extended, so a type-hierarchy seems impossible.
* However a record can implement interfaces.
* and interfaces can [black]`extend` other interfaces, even more than classes can.
* and since an [blue]`interface` can have a [black]`static` inner classes

it is quite simple to do, giving all benefits of the record type and a proper hierarchy.

The trick is to give each (relevant) interface an static inner class of the record type, you are done.
